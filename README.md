# cyberâ€¢Drop core

## Installation

To build all nessesary containers (clickhouse, parity, tabix, core), use command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Maybe, you'll have to wait a bit while parity will get an actual info from Ethereum chain

## Usage

### Real-time synchronization

To start real-time synchronization loop, use:
```bash
docker-compose run core start
```

To start synchronization with additional info for contracts whitelisted in config.py (extract ABI, parse inputs), use:
```bash
docker-compose run core start-full
```

### Stats

Docker bundle contains tabix dashboard named "ETH SQL" that shows status of synchronization. You can look at the state of database [here](http://localhost:8080).

This query checks the actual state over all blocks, unsynchronized blocks and contracts.

### Examples

Usage examples of the crawlers are located in **examples** dir of this repo. The actual list of examples goes below:
- [Gas price estimator](https://gitlab.com/cyberdrop/core/blob/docker_compose/examples/gas_price_estimation)

## Advanced usage

### Installation with vanilla docker

To build docker container, use command

```bash
docker build -t cyberdrop/core .
```

To install parity, use:

```bash
docker pull parity/parity:stable
docker run -p 8545:8545 parity/parity --jsonrpc-interface=all --tracing=on
```

To install clickhouse, use:

```bash
docker pull yandex/clickhouse-server:18.12.17
docker run yandex/clickhouse-server -p 9000:9000 -p 8123:8123 
```

You can see actual options for these containers in docker-compose.yml file

Make sure you've activated clickhouse and parity ports. 

```bash
$ curl localhost:8545
Used HTTP Method is not allowed. POST or OPTIONS is required

$ curl localhost:9000
Port 9000 is for clickhouse-client program.
You must use port 8123 for HTTP.
```

Check the correctness of the installation using

```bash
docker run --network host cyberdrop/core test
```

You can run other operations the same way

### Configuration

Configuration is located in config.py file. Please check this list before installation:

```python
...

# URLs of parity APIs.
# You can specify block range for each URL to use different nodes for each request
PARITY_HOSTS = [...]

# Dictionary of table names in database.
# Meaning of each table explained in Schema
INDICES = {...}

# List of contract addresses to process in several operations.
# All other contracts will be skipped during certain operations
PROCESSED_CONTRACTS = [...]

# Size of pages received from Clickhouse
NUMBER_OF_JOBS = 1000 # recommended

# Number of chunks processed simultaneously during input parsing
INPUT_PARSING_PROCESSES = 10 # recommended

# Number of blocks processed simultaneously during events extraction
EVENTS_RANGE_SIZE = 10 # recommended

# API key for etherscan.io ABI extraction
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "..."

...
```

### Bug reports

```
TODO will be updated
```

Before submitting bug reports, check the correctness of the installation using:
```bash
docker-compose run core test
```

### All operations
```bash
$ docker-compose run core --help

Usage: extractor.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

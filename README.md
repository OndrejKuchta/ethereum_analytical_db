# cyberâ€¢Drop core

### Installation

To build all nessesary containers (clickhouse, parity, grafana, core), use command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Maybe, you'll have to wait a bit while parity will get an actual info from Ethereum chain


### Real-time synchronization

To start real-time synchronization loop, use:
```bash
docker-compose run core start
```

To start synchronization with additional info for contracts whitelisted in config.py (extract ABI, parse inputs), use:
```bash
docker-compose run core start-full
```

### Database state

Docker bundle contains grafana with dashboard. You can look at the state of database [here](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/cyberdrop).

![Dashboard](./images/dashboard.png)

**Username**: admin

**Password**: admin

Make sure you have 8123 and 3000 ports enabled

### Examples

Usage examples of the crawlers are located in [**examples**](https://github.com/cyber-drop/ethereum_analytical_db/tree/master/examples) dir of this repo. The actual list of examples goes below:
- [SQL queries](https://github.com/cyber-drop/ethereum_analytical_db/tree/master/examples/sql_balances)
- [API](https://github.com/cyber-drop/ethereum_analytical_db/tree/master/examples/balances_api)
- [Jupyter Notebook: gas price estimator](https://github.com/cyber-drop/ethereum_analytical_db/tree/master/examples/gas_price_estimation)

### Bug reports

Feel free to create an issue for the project, if you have a problem with installation. 
Please provide us the following info:
- Your docker and docker-compose versions
- The list of your modifications in containers
- Actual state of the database (as a screenshot from grafana)
- The log for unit tests:
```bash
docker-compose run core test
```

## Advanced usage

### Installation with vanilla docker

To build docker container, use command

```bash
docker build -t cyberdrop/core .
```

To install parity, use:

```bash
docker pull parity/parity:stable
docker run -p 8545:8545 parity/parity --jsonrpc-interface=all --tracing=on
```

To install clickhouse, use:

```bash
docker pull yandex/clickhouse-server:18.12.17
docker run yandex/clickhouse-server -p 9000:9000 -p 8123:8123 
```

You can see actual options for these containers in docker-compose.yml file

Make sure you've activated clickhouse and parity ports. 

```bash
$ curl localhost:8545
Used HTTP Method is not allowed. POST or OPTIONS is required

$ curl localhost:9000
Port 9000 is for clickhouse-client program.
You must use port 8123 for HTTP.
```

Check the correctness of the installation using

```bash
docker run --network host cyberdrop/core test
```

You can run other operations the same way

### Configuration

Configuration is located in config.py file. Please check this list before installation:

```python
...

# URLs of parity APIs.
# You can specify block range for each URL to use different nodes for each request
PARITY_HOSTS = [...]

# Dictionary of table names in database.
# Meaning of each table explained in Schema
INDICES = {...}

# List of contract addresses to process in several operations.
# All other contracts will be skipped during certain operations
PROCESSED_CONTRACTS = [...]

# Size of pages received from Clickhouse
BATCH_SIZE = 1000 # recommended

# Number of chunks processed simultaneously during input parsing
INPUT_PARSING_PROCESSES = 10 # recommended

# Number of blocks processed simultaneously during events extraction
EVENTS_RANGE_SIZE = 10 # recommended

# API key for etherscan.io ABI extraction
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "..."

...
```

### All operations
```bash
$ docker-compose run core --help
